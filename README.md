**ServiceNow Project: Optimizing User, Group, Role, Table, ACL, and Workflow Management**
This project provides a structured approach to defining and managing users, roles, groups, tables, ACLs, and automated workflows in ServiceNow for a small project management team.

**Project Overview**
The solution aims to resolve the lack of clear role definitions, access controls, and workflow organization in project management. It demonstrates how to set up a ServiceNow-based environment to enhance accountability, streamline task assignments, and improve progress tracking for team members like a Project Manager and a Team Member.

**Features**
User creation and management (Project Manager, Team Member)

Group configuration for project teams

Role-based access permissions

Custom tables for project and task tracking

Assignments of users to groups and roles

Application permission controls

ACL (Access Control List) setup for data security

Automated workflow using Flow Designer for task and approval management

**Installation & Setup**
**Prerequisites**
ServiceNow instance access

Admin privileges in ServiceNow

**Steps**
**Create Users**

Navigate: All > Users (System Security)

Add new users Alice (Project Manager) and Bob (Team Member)

**Create Groups**

Navigate: All > Groups (System Security)

Create "Project Team Group" and add Alice and Bob

**Create Roles**

Navigate: All > Roles (System Security)

Create roles: projectmanager, teammember

Assign appropriate permissions to each role

**Assign Roles to Users**

Add created roles to respective users in user records

**Create Tables**

Define Project Table and Task Table 2

Add columns for names, descriptions, assignments, statuses, comments

**Assign Users to Groups**

Edit group membership and confirm Alice and Bob are members

**Assign Applications to Roles**
Assign table applications to appropriate roles through the Application Navigator

**Configure ACLs**

Create specific Access Control rules for tables:

Set permissions so only appropriate users can read/write comments and statuses

Test by impersonating users to verify access

**Design Workflows**

Use Flow Designer to automate tasks:

Trigger: Task record creation or update

Actions: Auto-update status, request approvals

**Test Workflow**

Update records and confirm workflow triggers and approvals for task management

**Usage**
Project managers can create, assign, and update tasks.

Team members can view and update only their assigned tasks.

Changes to task status and comments are handled securely via ACLs.

Workflow rules automate task status updates and approvals.

**Support**
